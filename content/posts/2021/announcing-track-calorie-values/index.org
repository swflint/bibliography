In an effort to take control of my health, I've started to keep track of what I eat.  To make collecting this information easier, I've written a package to cache foods and their relevant calorie values.  It's fairly simple at the moment, but I intend on eventually making it a bit more generic, and potentially even connecting to public APIs to get more complete nutrition data. 

It's available [[https://git.sr.ht/~swflint/track-calorie-values][here]].
