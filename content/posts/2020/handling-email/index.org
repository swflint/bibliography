Almost everyone has to deal with email, and to be honest, it kinda sucks.  Granted, so would dealing with all the email I get as hard-copy, but at least with email, there aren't anywhere /near/ as many trees that get killed/used.  But, dealing with email is still tough, and potentially quite time-consuming.  As an avid Emacs user, you can guess how I read my email --- in Emacs.  I'll talk a bit about my server-side mail infrastructure as well as the client-side handling in Gnus.
