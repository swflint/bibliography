* Wait, what?

I received a Reward Check from Dr. Donald Knuth!  It's true.  I reported an error in a book.  And I got a check.

* What For?

An error on the cover of "Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About".  There's a missing space between a comma and the word aesthetics, and I reported it.

* Can I see it?

Sure!

It looks like this:
