I'm an avid user of PGP, and enjoy the benefits of its use for message security and maintenance of privacy.  If you are capable of doing so, please sign your messages or even encrypt them.  My key is available on ~hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net~, my key ID is ~FA13D704~ (also available [[file:/attach/FA13D704.asc][here]]).
