My name is Sam Flint.  I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Nebraska---Lincoln studying Computer Science.  I completed my BS in the same at the same in 2020.  My background is in fundamentals and classical AI, but I'm currently studying Machine Learning and related techniques, and am interested in effective undergraduate Computer Science education.

Outside of the academic, I'm a firm supporter of Free Software, and contribute to several projects, as well as maintain some of my own (see [[{{< ref "pages/projects/index.org">}}][here]]), and am an ardent Emacs user.  My other hobbies include cooking, baking, antique collecting and as of late, bicycling.
