  Under the Nebraska Public Records Law, \S 84-712 \emph{et seq.},
  I request the opportunity to inspect, review, or obtain copies of the
  following records:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Record 1
  \item Record 2
  \item \ldots
  \item Record \(n\)
  \end{itemize}

  The law requires that you respond within four business days.  If
  that timeline is found to be unreasonable, or if the costs involved
  in retrieving, redacting, and/or reproducing the records as
  requested is estimated to be over \$50, I request that you notify me
  via US Mail.  I further, however, also request that these fees be
  waived as a student of the institution and a party deeply interested
  in the resolution of the situation.

  Furthermore, if this request is denied, either in its entirety or in
  part, please notify me of \emph{all} specific justifications and the
  appropriate appeals process.

  If you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate
  to contact me.

  \closing{Respectfully yours,}
