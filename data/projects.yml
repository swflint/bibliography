   description:
     NixOS is a distribution of GNU/Linux that uses an entirely
     different model for package management and configuration.
     Configuration is entirely declarative, with reproducibility one
     of the most significant goals of the project.  I package a couple
     of programs, and have contributed some minor bug-fixes to others.
