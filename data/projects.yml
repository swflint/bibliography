     NixOS is a distribution of GNU/Linux that uses an entirely
     different model for package management and configuration.
     Configuration is entirely declarative, with reproducibility one
     of the most significant goals of the project.  I package a couple
     of programs, and have contributed some minor bug-fixes to others.

     This is the theme that runs this blog.  I've contributed support
     for mathematics, the ability to include an ORCiD social icon, use
     of/support for "last modified" dates, and a more configurable
     footer.

     A configurable multi-repository synchronization tool with easy
     support for many kinds of repositories.  This was my first
     project in Rust, and I found it to be fairly interesting.
