   abstract:
     Many software engineering research papers rely on time-based data
     (*e.g.,* commit timestamps, issue report creation/update/close
     dates, release dates).  Like most real-world data, however,
     time-based data is often dirty.  To date, there are no studies
     that quantify how frequently such data is used by the software
     engineering research community, or investigate sources of and
     quantify how often such data is dirty.  Depending on the research
     task and method used, including such dirty data could affect the
     research results.  This paper presents the first survey of papers
     that utilize time-based data, published in the Mining Software
     Repositories (MSR) conference series.  Out of the 690 technical
     track and data papers published in MSR 2004--2020, we saw at
     least 35% of papers utilized time-based data.  We then used the
     Boa and Software Heritage infrastructures to help identify and
     quantify several sources of dirty commit timestamp data.
     Finally, we provide guidelines/best practices for researchers
     utilizing time-based data from Git repositories.
